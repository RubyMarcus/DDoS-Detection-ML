# Enhancing DDoS Attack Detection: A Hybrid Machine Learning Approach

## Overview
Project by Marcus Lundgren and Fredrik Johansson aiming to improve DDoS attack detection using machine learning.

### Date: March 27, 2024

## Setup Instructions
Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebook are installed.

### Required Libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- xgboost

Install with pip:
	pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib xgboost

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Open Jupyter Notebook.
2. Open the project notebook file.
3. Run all cells in order.

## Contents of the Notebook
- Data loading and cleaning.
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Training machine learning models for DDoS detection.
- Evaluation and visualization of model performance.

## Additional Information
- Models evaluated based on accuracy and F1 score.
- To run the notebook you NEED to download the dataset from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html and add the directory '01-12' to your project directory.
